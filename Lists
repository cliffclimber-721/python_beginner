When we declare "List", [] has to follow.

EX1)
list_a = [1, 2, 3, 4]          #Consists of integers
list_b = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]       #Consists of strings
list_c = [1, "a", 8, 9, "sky", "blue", 721]        #Can combine with integer and string for elements

Those what I've declared inside [], they call it elements.


🤖 It has various kinds of lists that can write on codes.

EXAMPLE LIST 
>> list_c = [1, "a", 8, 9, "sky", "blue", 721, [2, 3, 4]]


#1
list_c[0] >> 1

#2
list_c[1:3] >> ['a', 8]

- For this, it calls up the elements that are in index 1 and 2.

#3
list_c[-2] >> 'blue'

- It goes backwards when it comes to negative numbers for index.

#4
list_c[4] >> 'sky'
list_c[4][1] >> 'k'

#5
list_c[7] >> [2, 3, 4]
list_c[7][2] >> 4



🤖 Lists can calculate each other.
